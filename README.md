# AT-Appium_Facebook_Logo

This code uses the Appium Python client to initialize the webdriver, open the Chrome browser, navigate to facebook.com, and check if the Facebook logo element is visible on the page to verify successful loading. If the logo is found, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints a failure message.
